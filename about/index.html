My work involved automating the extraction of critical information from complex documents and designing a robust, multi-tenant serverless AWS architecture to support our solutions. Furthermore, I led the development of an evaluation framework for prompt engineering to enhance our RAG model&rsquo;s effectiveness. Outside of natural language processing, my tenure also included leading the MoleculeAI project, where we utilized graph neural networks to revolutionize the drug discovery process, and a product placement project that used diffusion models to generate realistic looking backgrounds for retail items.</p><p>Beyond my professional endeavors, I&rsquo;m an advocate for open-source software and continuously explore new technologies. I&rsquo;m currently developing a local-first recipe management system that I plan to open-source. As a Linux enthusiast, I enjoy experimenting with NixOS among other distributions. When I step away from the keyboard, I find joy in playing ultimate frisbee, backpacking, and waterskiing, embracing the balance between my digital and outdoor worlds.</p></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
