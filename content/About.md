Hello :hand:, my name is Justin Waltrip.

<img src="/images/cognistx-logo.png" style="float: right; margin: 20px" width="30%">
I currently work as a Data Scientist for artificial intelligence company <a href="https://www.cognistx.com" target="_blank">Cognistx</a> based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  
I am also involved with research in computer science and applied mathematics at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland.

My interests include natural language processing, specifically question answering using knowledge graphs and large language models, and geometric machine learning with graph neural networks.

Beyond data science, I also have experience with cloud/software engineering and full-stack web development. 
I have designed, implemented, deployed, and managed Amazon Web Service (AWS) serverless environments for multiple clients. 
I also have experience as a product manager, frontend, and backend developer for several interactive web applications and dashboards (although not all at once).

I am comfortable working with many programming languages, including Python, Javascript, Java, and C/C++. 
For data science, I have experience with PyTorch/PyTorch Geometric, Tensorflow, Ray, Data Version Control (DVC), LightGBM, Weights and Biases, scikit-learn, numpy, huggingface, and pandas. 
For web development, I have worked with MongoDB, ExpressJS, React, Node, MaterialUI, and Streamlit.
