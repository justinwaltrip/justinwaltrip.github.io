## Career Journey

### Squary AI / Cognistx (May 2021 - Present)

I joined **Cognistx**, an AI consulting startup, in May 2021 as a Data Scientist, where I crafted bespoke AI solutions for over 10 clients across industries including legal, healthcare, and retail. My role also allowed me to dive into the world of digital media as a co-host for the **AI-Driven podcast**, exploring the forefront of enterprise AI innovations.

In **January 2025**, I became Co-founder & Head of Engineering as SQUARE evolved into **Squary AI**, now a product-focused company serving legal and regulated industries.

### Technical Leadership

I lead product architecture, ingestion & indexing pipelines powering Squary AI, overseeing model optimization, scaling, and team delivery for enterprise-grade reliability & security.

I spearheaded the technical development of **SQUARE** (now evolved into Squary AI), an advanced enterprise question answering system that integrates extractive QA with retrieval augmented generation (RAG).

Key contributions included:

- Automating extraction of critical information from complex documents
- Designing a robust, multi-tenant serverless AWS architecture
- Leading development of an evaluation framework for prompt engineering to enhance RAG model effectiveness
- Building cross-format AI search across text, audio, video, spreadsheets, and complex case materials
- Implementing seamless integrations with SharePoint, Filevine, Google Drive, and other document management systems

### Additional Projects

Outside of natural language processing, my work also included:

- **MoleculeAI**: Utilized graph neural networks to revolutionize the drug discovery process
- **Product Placement**: Used diffusion models to generate realistic backgrounds for retail items

### Previous Experience

Before Squary AI/Cognistx, I co-founded **Nexxt Labs LLC** (April 2017 - April 2020), where I gained early entrepreneurial experience in technology ventures.

## Beyond Work

Beyond my professional endeavors, I'm an advocate for **open-source software** and continuously explore new technologies. I'm currently developing a local-first recipe management system that I plan to open-source.

As a **Linux enthusiast**, I enjoy experimenting with NixOS among other distributions. When I step away from the keyboard, I find joy in playing ultimate frisbee, backpacking, and waterskiing, embracing the balance between my digital and outdoor worlds.
