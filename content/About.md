</p>

I currently lead engineering at **Squary AI**, a workflow-driven AI platform for legal and regulated industries. Trusted by leading law firms including Quatrini Law Group, Aldridge Pite, and other plaintiff and defense firms, Squary AI unifies case documents—pleadings, discovery, medical records, transcripts, spreadsheets, and audio—into one secure platform.

### Key Achievements

- **70%** reduction in document review time
- **80%** minimization of case oversight risks
- **50%** acceleration of strategy pivots
- **500,000+** pages processed across **1,000+** workflows

Our platform features parallel task execution, attorney-ready outputs, and seamless integrations with SharePoint, Filevine, and Google Drive, delivering source-linked answers that integrate directly into legal workflows.

## Previous Experience

Before Squary AI, my professional path led me to **Cognistx**, an AI consulting startup, where I spent over three years as a Data Scientist crafting bespoke AI solutions for over 10 clients across industries including legal, healthcare, and retail. My role also allowed me to dive into the world of digital media as a co-host for the **AI-Driven podcast**, exploring the forefront of enterprise AI innovations.

### Technical Leadership

During my time at Cognistx, I spearheaded the technical development of **SQUARE** (now evolved into Squary AI), an advanced enterprise question answering system that integrates extractive QA with retrieval augmented generation (RAG).

Key contributions included:

- Automating extraction of critical information from complex documents
- Designing a robust, multi-tenant serverless AWS architecture
- Leading development of an evaluation framework for prompt engineering to enhance RAG model effectiveness

### Additional Projects

Outside of natural language processing, my tenure also included:

- **MoleculeAI**: Utilized graph neural networks to revolutionize the drug discovery process
- **Product Placement**: Used diffusion models to generate realistic backgrounds for retail items

## Beyond Work

Beyond my professional endeavors, I'm an advocate for **open-source software** and continuously explore new technologies. I'm currently developing a local-first recipe management system that I plan to open-source.

As a **Linux enthusiast**, I enjoy experimenting with NixOS among other distributions. When I step away from the keyboard, I find joy in playing ultimate frisbee, backpacking, and waterskiing, embracing the balance between my digital and outdoor worlds.
