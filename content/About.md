Hello :hand:, my name is Justin Waltrip.

I am currently studying computer science and applied mathematics at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland.  I also work as a Data Scientist for artificial intelligence company <a href="https://www.cognistx.com" target="_blank">Cognistx</a> based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.<br><br>

<img src="/images/knowledge-graph.png" style="float: left; margin: 20px" width="20%">
I am interested in natural language processing, including question answering using knowledge graphs and large language models, and geometric machine learning, specifically using graph neural networks.<br><br>

Outside of data science, I also have experience with software engineering and full-stack web development.  I have designed, implemented, deployed, and managed Amazon Web Service (AWS) serverless environments for multiple clients.  I have also served as product manager and as both frontend and backend developer for several interactive web applications and dashboards.

I am comfortable working with many programming languages, including Python, Javascript, Java, and C/C++.  For data science, I have experience with PyTorch/PyTorch Geometric, Tensorflow, Ray, Data Version Control (DVC), LightGBM, Weights and Biases, scikit-learn, numpy, huggingface, and pandas.  For web development, I have worked with MongoDB, ExpressJS, React, Node, MaterialUI, and Streamlit.
