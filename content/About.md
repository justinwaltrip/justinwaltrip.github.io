I'm <img align="right" src="/images/jhu.png" alt="Johns Hopkins University" width="200" style="margin: 20px"> Justin Waltrip, Co-founder & Head of Engineering at Squary AI, with a passion for leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence to address real-world challenges. My academic journey began at Johns Hopkins University, where I pursued dual majors in computer science and applied mathematics, laying a solid foundation for my career in technology.

I currently lead engineering at Squary AI, a focused Legal AI platform that has grown from a simple question answering interface to a comprehensive solution used by legal teams. Our platform has processed over 500,000 pages across 1,000+ workflows, delivering structured outputs with source-linked answers that integrate directly into existing legal workflows.<br>

Before Squary AI, my professional path led me to Cognistx, an AI consulting startup, where I spent over three years as a Data Scientist crafting bespoke AI solutions for over 10 clients across industries including legal, healthcare, and retail. My role also allowed me to dive into the world of digital media as a co-host for the AI-Driven podcast, exploring the forefront of enterprise AI innovations.<br>

During my time at Cognistx, I spearheaded the technical development of SQUARE (now evolved into Squary AI), an advanced enterprise question answering system that integrates extractive QA with retrieval augmented generation (RAG). My work involved automating the extraction of critical information from complex documents and designing a robust, multi-tenant serverless AWS architecture to support our solutions. Furthermore, I led the development of an evaluation framework for prompt engineering to enhance our RAG model's effectiveness. Outside of natural language processing, my tenure also included leading the MoleculeAI project, where we utilized graph neural networks to revolutionize the drug discovery process, and a product placement project that used diffusion models to generate realistic looking backgrounds for retail items.

Beyond my professional endeavors, I'm an advocate for open-source software and continuously explore new technologies. I'm currently developing a local-first recipe management system that I plan to open-source. As a Linux enthusiast, I enjoy experimenting with NixOS among other distributions. When I step away from the keyboard, I find joy in playing ultimate frisbee, backpacking, and waterskiing, embracing the balance between my digital and outdoor worlds.
