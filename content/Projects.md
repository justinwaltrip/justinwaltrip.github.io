# SQUARE

<a href="https://www.cognistx.com/square" target="_blank">SQUARE</a> (Scalable Question Answering and Recommendation Engine) is an end-to-end platform that automates the process of manually searching information from documents, images, and relational databases.  I am currently the lead data scientist for this project, and I have been working on it for the last 6 months.  SQUARE uses a combination of natural language processing techniques, large language models, and knowledge graphs to extract useful pieces of information from large sources of unstructured data.  SQUARE is currently being used by a legal company to automate their document reviews.

# Split.it

<img src="/images/split-it-logo.png" style="float: right; margin: 10px" width="30%">
<a href="https://www.trysplit.it" target="_blank">Split.it</a> is a ride-sharing application which helps students to save money by splitting the cost of Ubers and Lyfts.  The web inferface allows users to post rideshare events to our communal calendar so that other students can view available trips, join rides, and easily communicate with passengers.  Our application has over 250 active users with over 100 completed trips.  I am currently the product manager and lead for our team of 7 students, but I started as a full-stack developer and wrote the majority of our frontend user interface.  Split.it uses MongoDB, ExpressJS, React, and Node, otherwise known as the MERN technology stack.  We also have a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230824223457/https://apps.apple.com/us/app/split-it-cost-pooling/id1637904610" target="_blank">mobile app</a> available on the iOS app store.

# Molecular Property Prediction

Another project I am heavily involved with at Cognistx is MoleculeAI.  Our product allows early-stage drug discovery companies to significantly reduce the time and cost associated with the lead identification and optimization phases of small molecule drug discovery.
