As Co-founder & Head of Engineering at <a href="https://www.squary.ai" target="_blank">Squary AI</a>, I lead the development of a focused Legal AI platform that has evolved from SQUARE, an Enterprise Question Answering System. Squary AI helps legal teams process complex documents efficiently using extractive QA and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) techniques. The platform has achieved significant traction:

- Delivering structured outputs with source-linked answers that integrate into existing legal workflows
- Built on multi-tenant, serverless AWS architecture ensuring scalability and reliability
- Implementing evaluation and prompt-tuning frameworks to optimize large language model (LLM) performance
- Developing automated information extraction using advanced knowledge graphs

Squary AI is an active project (May 2021 - Present) with consistent engagement and adoption across legal teams, demonstrating real product-market fit in the legal AI space.

<a href="https://www.trysplit.it" target="_blank">Split.it</a> is a ridesharing platform I co-founded, designed to facilitate cost-effective travel options for users. As a Co-Founder, I led a development team of 7, achieving significant milestones:

- Garnering over 250 active users and facilitating more than 400 rideshare trips.
- Developing a user-friendly web interface, accessible across desktop and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230824223457/https://apps.apple.com/us/app/split-it-cost-pooling/id1637904610" target="_blank">mobile</a> platforms as a Progressive Web App, ensuring a seamless user experience.

This project was active from January 2022 to April 2024.

# CourseChat

CourseChat, an Independent Study project, is a Chatbot Assistant designed to help students with coding questions. As a Data Scientist on this project from January 2024 to May 2024, I was responsible for:

- Creating a vector database and implementing an RAG orchestration layer to enhance chatbot performance.
- Developing an automated evaluation pipeline for prompt engineering using user feedback, significantly improving the chatbot’s ability to assist students effectively.

# Product Placement

As a Data Scientist for Product Placement, a Proof-of-Concept project, I innovated by creating a tool that leverages Stable Diffusion to automatically generate realistic shadows and reflections, enhancing visual content. My contributions include:

- Designing a serverless AWS architecture to deploy low-cost inference APIs, demonstrating the project's feasibility and potential for scalability.

This project showcases my commitment to pushing the boundaries of AI and machine learning in practical applications.
