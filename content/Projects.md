As Co-founder & Head of Engineering at <a href="https://www.squary.ai" target="_blank">Squary AI</a>, I lead the development of a workflow-driven AI platform for legal and regulated industries. Evolved from SQUARE, an Enterprise Question Answering System, Squary AI now serves leading law firms including Quatrini Law Group, Aldridge Pite, and firms across plaintiff, defense, and personal injury practices. The platform has achieved remarkable measurable impact:

- **70% reduction in document review time** through AI-powered analysis that extracts key clauses and highlights inconsistencies
- **80% decrease in case oversight risks** by centralizing pleadings, discovery, medical records, and evidence in one secure workspace
- **50% faster strategy pivots** with parallel task execution and attorney-ready outputs (timelines, issue lists, draft language)
- Processed over **500,000 pages across 1,000+ workflows** with source-linked answers
- Built on **multi-tenant, serverless AWS architecture** with VPC isolation, encryption, and two-factor authentication
- **Seamless integrations** with SharePoint, Filevine, Google Drive, and other document management systems
- **Cross-format AI search** across text, audio, video, spreadsheets, and complex case materials
- Automated color-coded highlighting of payment terms, termination clauses, and liability limitations
- Real-time collaboration with secure, role-based access and full audit trails

Squary AI is an active project (May 2021 - Present) with strong product-market fit, serving law firms and legal teams across litigation, investigation, and compliance workflows.

<a href="https://www.trysplit.it" target="_blank">Split.it</a> is a ridesharing platform I co-founded, designed to facilitate cost-effective travel options for users. As a Co-Founder, I led a development team of 7, achieving significant milestones:

- Garnering over 250 active users and facilitating more than 400 rideshare trips.
- Developing a user-friendly web interface, accessible across desktop and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230824223457/https://apps.apple.com/us/app/split-it-cost-pooling/id1637904610" target="_blank">mobile</a> platforms as a Progressive Web App, ensuring a seamless user experience.

This project was active from January 2022 to April 2024.

# CourseChat

CourseChat, an Independent Study project, is a Chatbot Assistant designed to help students with coding questions. As a Data Scientist on this project from January 2024 to May 2024, I was responsible for:

- Creating a vector database and implementing an RAG orchestration layer to enhance chatbot performance.
- Developing an automated evaluation pipeline for prompt engineering using user feedback, significantly improving the chatbot’s ability to assist students effectively.

# Product Placement

As a Data Scientist for Product Placement, a Proof-of-Concept project, I innovated by creating a tool that leverages Stable Diffusion to automatically generate realistic shadows and reflections, enhancing visual content. My contributions include:

- Designing a serverless AWS architecture to deploy low-cost inference APIs, demonstrating the project's feasibility and potential for scalability.

This project showcases my commitment to pushing the boundaries of AI and machine learning in practical applications.
