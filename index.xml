I currently work as a Data Scientist for artificial intelligence company Cognistx based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I am also involved with research in computer science and applied mathematics at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. My interests include natural language processing, specifically question answering using knowledge graphs and large language models, and geometric machine learning with graph neural networks.
Beyond data science, I also have experience with cloud/software engineering and full-stack web development.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://www.justinwaltrip.com/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.justinwaltrip.com/contact/</guid><description>Contact me at justin.waltrip@protonmail.com or connect with me on LinkedIn.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://www.justinwaltrip.com/projects/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.justinwaltrip.com/projects/</guid><description>SQUARE Link to heading SQUARE (Scalable Question Answering and Recommendation Engine) is an end-to-end platform that automates the process of manually searching information from documents, images, and relational databases. I am currently the lead data scientist for this project, and I have been working on it for the last 6 months. SQUARE uses a combination of natural language processing techniques, large language models, and knowledge graphs to extract useful pieces of information from large sources of unstructured data.</description></item></channel></rss>
