I am currently studying computer science and applied mathematics at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. I also work as a Data Scientist for artificial intelligence company Cognistx based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
I am interested in natural language processing, including question answering using knowledge graphs and large language models, and geometric machine learning, specifically using graph neural networks.
Outside of data science, I also have experience with software engineering and full-stack web development.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://justinwaltrip.github.io/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://justinwaltrip.github.io/contact/</guid><description>Contact me at justin.waltrip@protonmail.com or connect with me on LinkedIn.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://justinwaltrip.github.io/projects/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://justinwaltrip.github.io/projects/</guid><description>Split.it Link to heading Split.it is a ride-sharing application which helps students to save money by splitting the cost of Ubers and Lyfts. The web inferface allows users to post rideshare events to our communal calendar so that other students can view available trips, join rides, and easily communicate with passengers. Our application has over 250 active users with over 100 completed trips. I am currently the product manager and lead for our team of 7 students, but I started as a full-stack developer and wrote the majority of our frontend user interface.</description></item></channel></rss>
