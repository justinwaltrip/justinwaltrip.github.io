As Co-founder & Head of Engineering at Squary AI, I lead the development of a workflow-driven AI platform for legal and regulated industries. Evolved from SQUARE, an Enterprise Question Answering System, Squary AI now serves leading law firms including Quatrini Law Group, Aldridge Pite, and firms across plaintiff, defense, and personal injury practices. The platform has achieved remarkable measurable impact:

70% reduction in document review time through AI-powered analysis that extracts key clauses and highlights inconsistencies
80% decrease in case oversight risks by centralizing pleadings, discovery, medical records, and evidence in one secure workspace
50% faster strategy pivots with parallel task execution and attorney-ready outputs (timelines, issue lists, draft language)
Processed over 500,000 pages across 1,000+ workflows with source-linked answers
Built on multi-tenant, serverless AWS architecture with VPC isolation, encryption, and two-factor authentication
Seamless integrations with SharePoint, Filevine, Google Drive, and other document management systems
Cross-format AI search across text, audio, video, spreadsheets, and complex case materials
Automated color-coded highlighting of payment terms, termination clauses, and liability limitations
Real-time collaboration with secure, role-based access and full audit trails

Squary AI is an active project (May 2021 - Present) with strong product-market fit, serving law firms and legal teams across litigation, investigation, and compliance workflows."><meta name=keywords content="developer,personal"><meta name=twitter:card content="summary"><meta name=twitter:title content="Justin Waltrip"><meta name=twitter:description content="Squary AI Link to heading As Co-founder & Head of Engineering at Squary AI, I lead the development of a workflow-driven AI platform for legal and regulated industries.
